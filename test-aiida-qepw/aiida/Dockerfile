# Make directory (if COPY in the line below creates it automatically, it then will
# belong to root and therefore you have permission problems)
RUN mkdir /home/aiida/.dockerscripts

## Copy startup scripts, will be used later
COPY ./scripts/ /home/aiida/.dockerscripts/

# Prepare the folders - the next command will assign it to the correct
# user, so it works with proper permissions when I mount 
# an external named volume
RUN mkdir ~/.aiida/ && mkdir ~/.ssh/keys

# Make  sure all things created have the right permissions
USER root
RUN chown -R aiida:aiida /home/aiida/.dockerscripts && \

# TO CHECK: also because we need to start the web service and install Apache
# expose https port (for rest? or maybe instead expose jupyter?)
#EXPOSE 443

# Important to end as user root (to run the init script)
USER root

# Use baseimage-docker's init system.
